# University Assignments and Topics

## About
This repository contains a collection of assignments and topics covered in the courses I took at the Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics (in English) of Babes-Bolyai University from Cluj-Napoca, Romania. The materials aim to provide an overview of foundational and advanced concepts in computer science and related fields.
